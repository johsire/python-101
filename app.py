# STRINGS
# A series of characters.
# Can use 'single' or "double" quotes to define strings.

# FORMATTED STRINGS

# Formatted String are easier to visualize the end result than Concatenated Strings in some cases.
# Formatted Strings contain holes/place holders that are symbolized by {} braces and we start the sentence with an 'f';

# first = 'Stewie'
# # last = 'Griffin'
# # message = first + ' [' + last + '] is an evil baby genius'
# # msg = f'{first} [{last}] is an evil baby genius'
# # print(message)
# # print(msg)

# STING METHODS
# Strings come with their own in-built functions - methods;
# course = 'Python for Beginners'
# print(course)


# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

# Operators precedence/ order of computing

# BODMAS

# Brackets
# Exponentiation/ to the power of
# Division or Multiplication
# Addition or Subtraction


# MATH FUNCTIONS

import math

# you have to import the math module in order to get the in-built functions that come with it - methods
# To access the methods we start with math(dot). followed by the name of the method you want to use
# absolute method always returns a positive number
# abs()
# math.floor()
# math.ceil()    e.t.c
